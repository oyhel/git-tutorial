## Tasks

- Create a local repository named after yourself separated by underscore, eg. oyvind_helgeland

- Create a file called README.md where you write a short text snippet about yourself. I want you to use markdown. It is a simple formatting language used by many tools, including Github (this text is written in markdown!). Use these two resources below to generate the text that you paste into the file (or just write it into the README.md directly):

  -  [Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
  -  [Online parser](https://dillinger.io/)

- Check the status. What does git tell you about the file?

- Add the file README.md and check the status. What does git tell you about the file?

- Commit the file README.md and check the status. What does git tell you?

- Check the log. What do you see?

## Github

We now want to push our file/repo to Github.

- Log in to your Github account and create a new repository (make it public). Read the instructions carefully. We want to push an existing repository. Follow the instructions to add a remote and push.

- View your README.md in Github. Is the formatting as expected?
